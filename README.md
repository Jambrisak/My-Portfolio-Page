[jambrisak - Live Webpage](https://www.jambrisak.com) (Right click top open in new tab)

This is my first project for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.bet) where I study for a diploma - <strong>LVL 5 in Full Stack Software Development. </strong>

The aim of this project is to demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS, in this project some JavaScript where used due to the creator wanted the site to look as good as possible.
But the use of JavaScript where limited. 

The website is responsive to lower screen resolutions, tablets and mobile phones. 
It is also compatible with all websites that are popular. Opera, Opera GX, Chrome, IE, Safari, Firefox.

The website is a one page only and is divided into different sections, where the consistency was the in the highest priority, its both simple and pleasant to navigate the site.
It contains all the necessary information that is expected to be present at a portfolio site, such as an about section, portfolio section and a contact section where users will find,
social links and an online form that will send a direct message to the creator.

## Design

### Design Choices
As a design for the website, I did not use ready-made dolour palettes, and instead, I decided to choose a background image that should give a modern and simplistic feel to the background.
Apart from the portfolio section each section has a white background, and that was a conscious choice due to the about section had some text and a background would distract the user. 
The same thinking was behind the contact section of the page, and the reason for there being a background image in the portfolio section was to highlight a section that the owner felt was the most important.
In addition, the navbar and footer have a black color. The navbar switches color when u start scrolling and the reason for it to first blend in is to give the illusion that the background image and navbar are on,
and the same. So when u start scrolling you see that the navbar changes color to stand out and showcase that now we are moving on from the first page and diving into who the creator is.
There are two other images on this page and one is of the creator and the other is an "coming soon" image that is a temporary image until the owner updates and add a picture and link to the next project.

Below is a list of the photos used.
### Background for Home & Portfolio
![background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1257288/188180211-4072451d-699a-4345-a408-a37b4b5dd249.jpg)

### Owner's picture

### Coming soon picture

### Fonts
'Poppins' regular 400 - taken from Google Fonts and apply via @import method to CSS file. 
I Chose this font because after a quick search on google on most used font for portfolio webpages, 'Poppins' regular 400 was the most popular choice, but its also because of its simplicity and ease of reading.

![Font](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1257288/188204836-a4a83c53-73c7-4be5-ae56-adf3e4c62c80.png)

### Structure

The website is constructed in on of the most frequently chose and user-friendly ways. At the top of the page, there is a navigation bar with links to other sections of the page,
below is the first section which is the home section, below is the about section, then comes the portfolio and lastly the contact with footer underneath.

The website consists of one page and 4 sections in total.
- Home
- About
- Portfolio
- Contact

### Wireframes
This is the prototype of the project that will showcase the creators idea and that it was possible to translate a wireframe to webpage.
There will a wireframe for each section of the page, it may not show the entire picture since the creator did not think of a resume button and or using icons to showcase skills until after development was started.

## Features

### Navigation Bar
![Navbar-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1257288/188001126-0208cbe0-c05f-4ce6-b126-4f11f11df9ba.png)
The navigation bar is present on the entire website, it is easily noticeable, intuitive and easy to use. The
navigation bar highlights the selected section where the user wants to go. There is also an effect when user scrolls down where the navigation size up and down and swtiches colors for the background and text.
On the left side, there is a logo that.The navigation bar is responsive to mobile devices - it then turns into a common in-use "hamburger menu".
## Navigation Bar Effect
### Scroll down effect / Sticky effect

### Hover effect
![Navbar-1-Hover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1257288/188194231-08374f02-b945-4d57-bfde-3adac5d71b7c.png)

### Hamburger
![Hamburger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1257288/188200192-f94e8f06-cb3a-418f-8c6e-5204c0d87fd0.png)
### Landing Page

The section on the main page is a first eye-catcher. It contains a the name of the creator and what he feels is the most important information about him.
In the section, we can see one button that will let the user download the creators resume.
restaurant. 

### About 
![About](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1257288/188001042-3ff238be-a4f7-42d1-b4b4-9dd39ceb19a3.png)
The "about us" section gives the user an insight into who the creator is, where he got his education from where the school names are links to the schools different pages.
The user can also get information on what skills the user claims to have.
To the right of the information section is a picture of the creator and white space left to the right of the picture, that was intentional from the creator, to give the illusion of the future.

### Gallery & Video
![Portfolio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1257288/188001154-0d79065c-fd0b-46ec-982d-c11359e073de.png)
A section where the user can currently only see the same picture four times, the idea is that users will bookmark this page too see what the creator will do for projects in the future.
The images also have an hover effect that will shrink them to let users know which image "future project" their mouse is on.

The user will to the left see the creators contact information, email, phone and two social links 1 that goes to the creators Linkdin profile and the other to the creators GitHub profile.
Next to the contact information, the user can find a contact form that allows the user to freely contact the creator online.

At the bottom of the page the user will see the footer, and it contains just a copyright claim from the creator.

## Validation

### HTML Validation

I used "W3C Markup Validation Service" to validate the code.  
I validated each of the subpages and no error was found on any of them.

### CSS Validation

I used "W3C CSS Validation Service" to validate the CSS code.

## Testing

### Accessibility
I used "The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool" to test the code for accessibility.  
The first test I conducted detected some errors relating to contrast errors about the chosen color for Logo, navbar but also on chosen color for the portfolio sections h1 and h2 tag.
The color that they wanted me to switch to would have changed the design for the page so I decided to ignore the contrast errors, I only did so because I had shown the website to 3 of my students,
and these 3 students all have dyslexia and one is color blind, and none of them had any trouble seeing the text on any device. The test also showed three errors that my form did not have any label. Which,
was also a design choice due to me already in the input and textarea had written the label. And here also I had checked with my students and not a single one had trouble seeing it.

### Performance

To test the performance on the website, I used Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools.
The test was carried out on computers and mobile devices.

## Deployment
The website was deployed on a Google Domain by using following steps:
1. Purchase of the domain.
2. Start a GitHub repository, go to github and create a new repository by clicking the green "new" button in the top of the left hand side. Give it a name and make it public and also check box for "add a README file"
3. Get set up with Github on your desktop, this is optional but to make it easier to use git push, commit, add commands for the website it makes it easier.
4. Set up your google domain,  go back to your google domains page and head to the DNS settings on the sidebar. 
	- Scroll down to the bottom section "custom Resource records", this is where u will sync up GitHub and Google Domain.
5. Add two things, 1. A record, 2. CNAME
	- A Record needs this information to work:
		- Name: @
		- Type: A
		- Time: 1h
		- Data: 185.199.108.153
	- CNAME
		- Name: www
		- TTL: 1h
		- Data: https://yourusername.github.io
6. Connect your github account to GitHub Pages and your domain.
	- Open up your repository and go to Settings tab and scroll down to GitHub Pages, in the custom domain section add the url for purchased domain.
	- After ur hit save it will do a DNS check and when it shows green its done, now you can go to ur custom domain.
