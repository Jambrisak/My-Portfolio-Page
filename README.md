# Personal Portfolio
I wanted to create a website that I could use for showcasing to future employers what I can do with HTML/CSS, this sites focus is on the future. What I aim is a good looking personal portfolio website, that will show to future employers that I not only care about the programming side but also the design aspect of web development.
On this site future employers will find information about me, my journey, my credentiels and my skills. They will also see what my current or upccoming projects are in the portfolio section. And in the last page they will find information on how to contact me either through mail, phone or my social links. There will also be a contact form for sending me a message directly.
