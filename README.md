This is my first project for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.bet) where I study for a diploma - <strong>LVL 5 in Full Stack Software Development. </strong>

The aim of this project is to demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS, in this project some JavaScript where used due to the creator wanted the site to look as good as possible.
But the use of JavaScript where limited. 

The website is responsive to lower screen resolutions, tablets and mobile phones. 
It is also compatible with all websites that are popular. Opera, Opera GX, Chrome, IE, Safari, Firefox.

The website is a one page only and is divided into different sections, where the consistency was the in the highest priority, its both simple and pleasant to navigate the site.
It contains all the necessary information that is expected to be present at a portfolio site, such as an about section, portfolio section and a contact section where users will find,
social links and an online form that will send a direct message to the creator.

## Design

### Design Choices
As a design for the website, I did not use ready-made dolour palettes, and instead, I decided to choose a background image that should give a modern and simplistic feel to the background.
Apart from the portfolio section each section has a white background, and that was a conscious choice due to the about section had some text and a background would distract the user. 
The same thinking was behind the contact section of the page, and the reason for there being a background image in the portfolio section was to highlight a section that the owner felt was the most important.
In addition, the navbar and footer have a black color. The navbar switches color when u start scrolling and the reason for it to first blend in is to give the illusion that the background image and navbar are on,
and the same. So when u start scrolling you see that the navbar changes color to stand out and showcase that now we are moving on from the first page and diving into who the creator is.
There are two other images on this page and one is of the creator and the other is an "coming soon" image that is a temporary image until the owner updates and add a picture and link to the next project.

Below is a list of the photos used.

### Fonts
'Poppins' regular 400 - taken from Google Fonts and apply via @import method to CSS file. 
I Chose this font because after a quick search on google on most used font for portfolio webpages, 'Poppins' regular 400 was the most popular choice, but its also because of its simplicity and ease of reading.

### Structure

The website is constructed in on of the most frequently chose and user-friendly ways. At the top of the page, there is a navigation bar with links to other sections of the page,
below is the first section which is the home section, below is the about section, then comes the portfolio and lastly the contact with footer underneath.

The website consists of one page and 4 sections in total.
- Home
- About
- Portfolio
- Contact

### Wireframes
This is the prototype of the project that will showcase the creators idea and that it was possible to translate a wireframe to webpage.
There will a wireframe for each section of the page, it may not show the entire picture since the creator did not think of a resume button and or using icons to showcase skills until after development was started.
